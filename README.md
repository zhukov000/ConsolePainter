# ConsolePainter
Using own BitmapLibrary for print BMP on Windows Console

This small client app print bmp file on windows console just using SetConsoleTextAttribute for color setting.

For convert colors use own function rgbToConsoleColor.

For loading BMP to memory was used another project: BitmapLibrary (https://github.com/zhukov000/BitmapLibrary)
